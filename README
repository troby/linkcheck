Basic tool for crawling a domain in search of missing links.

Currently, this tool only saves 404 errors to a special list,
but enabling verbose will provide output of every response
status code. Linkcheck will verify external links, but it will
not scrape them for further links to be tested.

Dependencies:
python3.x
requests
BeautifulSoup4

Usage:

import linkcheck
check = linkcheck.SiteChecker('mysite.com')
check.start()
check.results()

The following defaults can be changed before invoking start():
check.verbose = False
check.delay = 3


Functional test:
The localhost site tested by functional_test.py should
have the following files:

download.html:
<html>
<body>
<a href="test.mp3">music file</a>
<a href="missing_2.html">missing</a>
</body>
</html>

index.html:
<html>
<body>
<a href="download.html">downloads</a>
<a href="missing_1.html">missing</a>
</body>
</html>

test.mp3:
binary file data
