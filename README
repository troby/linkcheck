Basic tool for crawling a domain in search of missing links.

Currently, this tool only saves 404 errors to a special list,
but enabling verbose will provide output of every response
status code.

Usage:

import linkcheck
check = linkcheck.SiteChecker('mysite.com')
check.start()

The following defaults can be changed before invoking start():
check.verbose = False
check.delay = 3
